# Adverbs

## Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia adverbs end in **-o** and their place is before a verb
or at the end of the sentence.

**me _bono_ sona.**
– I well sleep.  
**me sona _bono_.**
– I sleep _well_.  
**te basha pandunia _bono_.**
– You speak Pandunia _well_.

## Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

**day ren**
– a big person  
**lil ren**
– a little person  
**sundari ren**
– a beautiful person

**dayo sundari ren**
– very beautiful person  
**lilo sundari ren**
– somewhat beautiful person


## Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **may** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **mayim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **samo** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ko** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of comparison.

**me si may bon ko te.**
= I am better than you.  
**te loga samo bono ko me.**
= You speak as well as me.
