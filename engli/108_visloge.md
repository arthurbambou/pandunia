# Pronouns

## Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

**me**
– I, me  
**te**
– you  
**le**
– he, she, it  
**mome**
– we  
**tote**
– you all  
**lole**
– they

## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**ze**
– self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **ze** is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vida ze**
– I see myself.  
**le vida ze**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mome vida ze.**
– We see ourselves.

## Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ye**
– this one  
**ve**
– that one

**me volu ye.**
– I want this one.  
**le volu we.**
– He/she wants that one.

They end in **-i** when they function as modifiers i.e. when they come before a noun.

**yi mav**
– This cat  
**vi mav**
– That cat

## Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ki xey?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ki ren?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ki zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  
**ki yang?**
– How? (What manner?)

The adverbial interrogative pronoun is **ko**
and it means the same as English _how_.

Also adjectives are questioned with **ki**.

**ko novi?**
– How new?  
**ko kosti?**
– How costy?  
**ko pol?**
– How many?  
**ko day?**
– How big?  
**ko lil?**
