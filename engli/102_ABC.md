# Spelling and pronunciation

Pandunia is phonetic in two directions:

1. When you read a word, you can always pronounce it.
2. When you hear a word, you can almost always write it.
   (Foreign names can be an exception.)

Once you have learned the few rules and the way letters are pronounced,
you can read Pandunia aloud and be understood.

## Basic Latin Alphabet

Pandunia is written in the basic Latin alphabet – the same as English!
It doesn't have any of the accented letters, which are different from language to language.
So it can be typed, printed and used with computers and smart devices in most countries without any difficulty.

## Sounds

Pandunia has its own sound system and its own spelling system
that are mostly similar to those of the languages of continental Europe and Latin America.

### Vowels

Pandunia has five oral vowels.
They are represented by the five vowel letters A, E, I, O and U in the writing system.

| Pandunia | IPA  | Pronunciation advise |
|:--------:|:----:|:---------------------|
| a        | /a/  | As in _father_. |
| e        | /e/  | As in _bet_. |
| i        | /i/  | As in _machine_. |
| o        | /o/  | As in _or_. |
| u        | /u/  | As in _rule_. |

There are also several common vowel sequences
– au, ou, ai, ei, oi –
which are pronounced as the consecutive vowels with or without a hiatus in between.

### Consonants

Pandunia has 20 consonant sounds.
Each sound is represented by a unique letter.
Most of them are pronounced as normally in English.
If a letter is pronounced differently,
the correct pronunciation is written down in the "Pronunciation advise" column.

| Pandunia | IPA     | Pronunciation advise |
|:--------:|:-------:|:---------------------|
| b        | /b/     | |
| c        | /tʃ~ts/ | Always like _ch_ in _chat_. |
| d        | /d/     | |
| f        | /f/     | |
| g        | /g/     | Always hard as in _get_. Never soft as in _gel_. |
| h        | /h/     | |
| j        | /dʒ/    | Always like J in judge_ or the soft _g_ in _gel_. |
| k        | /k/     | |
| l        | /l/     | |
| m        | /m/     | |
| n        | /n/     | |
| p        | /p/     | |
| r        | /r~ɹ/   | Always voiced as in American English. Can be trilled as in Indian English. Never silent! |
| s        | /s/     | Always voiceless like _s_ in _sissy_. |
| t        | /t/     | |
| v        | /v~ʋ~w/ | |
| w        | /w/     | |
| x        | /ʃ/     | Like _sh_ in _shop_. |
| y        | /j/     | Like _y_ in _yes_. |
| z        | /z/     | |

Note: **n** is pronounced with the tip of the tongue except in combinations **nk** and **ng**,
where it is velar /ŋ/ like in _banker_ and _finger_.
In the end of a word, the **g** in **ng** can be silent.
So the word **pang** can be pronounced /paŋ/ as well as /paŋg/.

## Word Structure

Pandunia words are structurally rather simple.
A syllable can include in maximum:

- one initial consonant
- one liquid consonant (**l** or **r**)
- one or two vowels, and
- one final consonant from the following: **m**, **n**, **ng**, **l**, **r**, **f**, **s**, **x**, and **h**.

Certain consonant clusters are also allowed only between vowels, like **ks** and **zn**.

Some of the heaviest words in practice are **kristal** and **simpli**.


## Adapting Loan Words

As a general rule, loan words are adapted to the phonetic spelling system of Pandunia.
This rule is applied to both common words and proper names.

### Common words

A common word refers to a thing as a member of a group, not as an individual.
For example _dog_ is a common word but _Sam_ is not, it is a proper name.

Common words, which are in general use, must fit into the normal word structure,
and they can include only the normal sounds of Pandunia.

Most Pandunia words are structurally simpler than the corresponding English words.
Difficult consonant groups are avoided in the beginning, middle and end of words,
so _stadium_ is **estadia**, _act_ is **ate**, and _saint_ is **santi** in Pandunia.
Also final stop consonants are avoided, so for example _soup_ is **supe** in Pandunia.


### Proper names

Infrequently used common nouns and proper nouns can be more complex than ordinary words.
They can even include sounds that don't belong to the normal sound inventory of Pandunia.

For example, family name _Smith_ may remain **Smith** in Pandunia,
although it is structurally more complex than common Pandunia words,
and it has the external _th_ sound.
However, foreign people probably will pronounce this name incorrectly.
Therefore it is advisable to adapt also proper names to the phonetic system of Pandunia.


## Large and Small Letters

Pandunia is normally written only in small letters (i.e. lower case letters).
Large letters are used only in special cases.

There are three reasons why large letters and rules about their usage are not necessary.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital letters" in speech.
   Still understanding spoken words is as easy as understanding written words.
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter type,
   i.e. they don't have separate large and small letters.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters.
   No need for special rules for capitalization.

Note! It's not a mistake to use the capital letters.
Sometimes people do it because they are accustomed to them in other languages.
But still capital letters are unnecessary and not recommended in Pandunia.

Capital letters are necessary in standard international acronyms.
For example: 10 Mb (desi megobite),
100 Gb (honi gigobite),
2 mm (duli milometre),
1 kJ (un kilojul).

#### Proper names

Personal names and other proper names can be capitalized although it's not necessary or recommended.
For example _Thomas Stearns Eliot_ would be written **Tomas Sternz Eliot** in Pandunia,
and it can be abbreviated to initial letters variously
**Tomas S Eliot**, **TS Eliot** and **TSE**.

In titles of artistic works, like books, songs and films, every word begins with a large letter.
For example,
**Putongi Loge Da Insani Hake**
(The Universal Declaration of Human Rights).

#### Acronyms

Initialisms, like **ASEAN**, **EU**, **NAFTA** and **UN**, are always written in large letters.
Other acronyms may use a mixture of large and small letters,
like for example **GULag**, which is an acronym of the Russian words "Glavnoye Upravleniye Lagerey".

Capital letters are also used in the standard international acronyms.
For example:
10 Mb (ten megabite),
100 GB (hunde gigabaite),
2 mm (due milimetre),
1 kJ (un kilojul).


## Syllabification

« - » Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen.
The hyphen is placed between spoken syllables. For example:
**bus**, **ka-fe**, **yu-mor**, **pos-te**, **kon-ca-nis-tia**.


## Punctuation

« . » All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

« ? » Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

« ! » Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

« ... » Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) indicates incompleteness or uncertainty.

« : » Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation, quotation or list.

« , » Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

Because the first word of sentences is not capitalized,
a space may be inserted _before_ and _after_ the punctuation mark
that ends the sentence.
This practice helps to put sentences clearly apart.

> undeno, me volu layu pa bazar . me mita mi doste .
> le loga: salam ! eska te boni ? me jawaba: me bon !
> mome layu pa mi doste du dom e yama cay .

In informal texts, smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used to indicate mood.
For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

**me suku te :)**
= I like you.  
**te no suku me :(**
= You don't like me.
