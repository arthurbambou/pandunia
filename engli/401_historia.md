# History of Pandunia

#### 2000
Risto Kupsala, a young student in Finland,
finds out about the classical auxiliary languages,
Esperanto, Ido, Volapük and Interlingua.
Inspired by them, he soon creates several crude drafts of an Europe-centred constructed auxiliary language.

Risto joins
[AUXLANG](https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=AUXLANG)
mailing list to discuss with other auxlangers.

#### 2003

Risto publishes an auxiliary language draft called _Lone_ in his personal web pages.
It has analytic grammar and it includes words from non-European languages,
which is extraordinary at those times.

Risto is contacted by Florent Garet,
a French auxlanger and the creator of _Luni_,
an auxlang that is inspired by the Japanese language.
They begin to exchange ideas by email.

#### 2004

Risto drafts a quota system for selecting words from different language families.
In his opinion the vocabulary of the world language should be evenly global
and not European or Western as in the classical auxiliary languages.
This idea becomes a guiding principle for the creation of Pandunia's vocabulary.

#### 2005

Risto, Florent, and
Jens Wilkinson (a USA born translator working in Japan, the creator of _Dunia Patwa_)
start a collaborative project for creating a multicultural world language.
The language is called _Gaia_.
It has analytic grammar and evenly global vocabulary.

In a time when electronic multilingual dictionaries were not available in the internet,
Risto creates a new collaborative wiki called
[Multilingual Vocabulary Resource (Mulivo)](mulivo.pbworks.com)
for finding out common words in widely spoken languages around the world.

#### 2006

The Gaia project is ended before completion.
Risto, Florent and Jens go their separate ways.
Jens reforms Dunia Patwa into _Neo Patwa_.

#### 2007

Risto and Jens work again together for a while.
This project _Pangaia_ and
it has analytic grammar and evenly global vocabulary.

Risto publishes the first version of _Pandunia_.
It has analytic grammar and evenly global vocabulary.

In the following years Risto develops Pandunia without a clear direction.
He is occupied by work and family life.

#### 2010

Risto starts to develop an agglutinative language as a private sideproject.
He invents the three types of verbs and their vowel endings
(active -a, passive -u, and stative -i).
The vowel endings are originally borrowed from Arabic verb patterns "faʕala", "faʕila" and "faʕula".

### 2012

Other people learn Pandunia for the first time.
A discussion group for Pandunia is created in Facebook social media.

#### 2013

Risto goes through a divorce and loses his interest for auxiliary languages for a while.
Things slow down again.

The source text of Pandunia website is changed to Markdown format
and it is stored in Git version control system and in
[GitHub](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia).

A new wave of people get interested about Pandunia.
Pandunia community begins to grow slowly but surely.

Discussion groups in Telegram instant messenger are created.

#### 2017

The analytic grammar of Pandunia turns out to produce too often sentences
that are ambiguous and/or difficult to understand.
The grammar is changed for agglutinating grammar
that uses vowel endings to indicate word-classes.
