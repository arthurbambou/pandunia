# Word derivation

New words can be built freely in Pandunia!
Pandunia has a productive system of word derivation.
Most of the suffixes that are used in Pandunia are already in international use.
Many of them come from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

## How to combine words

Two or more roots can be put together to make a _compound word_.
The last root is the most meaningful part in the compound
and the roots that come before it only modify its meaning.

Compound words are made of bare word stems and a vowel ending.

For example, this is how the word **andewisti** (atheistic) is made:

           an       (negation)
       +  dew       (god)
       +  ist       (proponent, -ist)
       +    i       (adjective ending)
   _____________
   = andewisti      (atheistic)

If joining bare stems together would result into a difficult consonant sequence,
a padding vowel **-o-** is inserted between them.

For example, this is how **termometer** (_thermometer_) is made:

         term       (temperature)
       +    o       (padding vowel)
       +  met       (measuring)
       +   er       (device)
    ____________
    = termometer    (thermometer)

## Function Words

_Function words_ are words that help to structure other words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a _closed class_ of words, so new words can never be added to it.
_Content words_, on the other hand, is an open, ever-growing class of words,
and they refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.
Function words have only a structural role
and therefore they behave differently than content words.

In Pandunia, function words have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
   Sometimes the same consonant is used for expressing two different ideas.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a determiner,
      which indicates definiteness or indefiniteness, distance, possession, etc.
    - **-o** indicates an adverb of manner
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition
